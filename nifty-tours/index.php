                <h2>ONE STORY</h2>
                <p><em>"While I was in Mycenae, Greece on a Nifty Tour, our group came upon a cistern -- an
                                ancient, long, dark underground storage area, that, legend has it, was the one Orestes
                                hid in after he'd killed his mother, Clytemnestra. Even though our tour guide warned
                                against it, I descended the icy steps to see what was inside.<br>
                                <br>
                            </em></p>
                <p><em>About halfway, I fell, crashing down to the cistern bottom. I didn't break anything, but
                                I believe I strained my orestes. I was eventually able to crawl out of that deadly hole
                                as my co-tourees took pictures. It's an exciting memory they'll never forget!
                                Personally, I repressed the trauma."</em></p>
